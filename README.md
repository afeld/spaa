# Single-Page App Architecture

In this talk, we will survey the landscape of techniques for building single-page web applications, for fun, profit, and most importantly, perceived performance. Compared to a traditional site with page refreshes for navigation and actions, single-page apps introduce complexity around state management, client-server synchronization and memory usage, and often increase initial page load time. Learn how to minimize the spinner and make your site feel responsive and continuous.

Instead of focusing on a particular server or client-side framework, we will lay out pros and cons of strategies for serving assets, passing data, shared templating and code, caching and managing dependencies, referencing tools that can help along the way. You will leave this session knowing how to evaluate the different approaches and decide what is right for your project.
